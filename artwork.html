             This artwork is of Ren Willson who can summon four elemental demons: Land, Air, Water, and Fire.
             Ren can either summon the demons to
             fight for him or he can summon parts of the demons onto his body, 
             like<br>demon summoners. The artwork above is Ren summoning all four demons at once. Ren's powers developed from a young age and the scar on his face was<br>
             giving to him by the Land demon that he had summoned at young age, as well as summoned at all the time.

            The Black Mane come from the same world as Ren Willson and Rory Vanson but years in the future in the story "Next Gen".
            Black Mane was inspired by<br>
            Marvels Kingpin and the artist, on instagram, oni8064's Empire Penguin.
            Black Mane is the leader of the Black Lions and within these Black Lions is a thing called "Addicts" where they put<br>
            monster blood in their blood.
            Black Mane's addict form was inpired by DC Bane and uses Chinese Guard Lion for the Blood.

            This hallway was designed for a game project called Overwrought, this games was an emotion based and this level is the begining of the happyness level. The
            happyness level starts in the hallway then you go<br>
            out to a beach where you have to build sand castles. On the team of Overwrought I was resposable for the concept
            art of the backgrounds, while drawn in a flat view it was desinged like this so that my team could use the<br>
            concepts as a refernce point of what to design the levels.
