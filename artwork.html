             This artwork is of Ren Willson who can summon four elemental demons: Land, Air, Water, and Fire.
             Ren can either summon the demons to
             fight for him or he can summon parts of the demons onto his body, 
             like<br>demon summoners. The artwork above is Ren summoning all four demons at once. Ren's powers developed from a young age and the scar on his face was<br>
             giving to him by the Land demon that he had summoned at young age, as well as summoned at all the time.

            The Black Mane come from the same world as Ren Willson and Rory Vanson but years in the future in the story "Next Gen".
            The Black Mane was inspired by<br>
            Marvels Kingpin and the artist, on instagram, oni8064's Empire Penguin.
            Black Mane is the leader of the Black Lions and within these Black Lions is a thing called "Addicts" where they put<br>
            monster blood in their blood.
            Black Mane's addict form was inpired by DC Bane and uses Chinese Guard Lion for the Blood.
